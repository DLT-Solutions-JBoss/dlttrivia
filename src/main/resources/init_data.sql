insert into question (question_id, question_text, answer_text, question_value) values (1, 'How does Red Hat work collaboratively with the open source community?','Open source is a development model that takes advantage of a collaborative and community-based development paradigm. Thousands of developers build and share code, and among those contributors you will find developers representing huge organizations like IBM and Intel. This level of collaboration is one reason for the incredible quality of open source.<br>The open source development model is fueled by a community of developers around the world, each working on different projects for different purposes, whereas proprietary models are limited by budget constraints and the vision of a select few individuals. This community effort allows for rapid innovation and higher quality software as the open source model permits developers to fix the bugs where they occur, as soon as they occur.<br>Red Hat continues to acquire effective technology companies to extend our range of solutions into new fields and to strengthen our product portfolio. In the open source model, the source code is accessible. You would not want to buy a car with the hood welded shut; you would want to see the engine so that you know what you are working with. But this freedom is not available in most proprietary models. If you notice a bug in a proprietary model, at best you can document the problem, or you can create aworkaround in your own code. The workaround is not a correct fix, but it might give you the behavior you need. Unfortunately, you cannot know for sure because you cannot see the original problem, only the shadows that it casts. The cumulative result is that open source software is considered to be significantly higher quality than proprietary software.<br> Because open source is a collaborative environment, thousands of developers have contributed hundreds of thousands of lines of code to thousands of open source projects and more are being created every day.<br>Red Hat takes the best code from the community base and make it usable in enterprise environments by hardening, testing, certifying, stabilizing, and supporting it. We take the code and invest a significant portion of our revenue into making it suitable for mission-critical environments.<br> Red Hat sponsors numerous communities to act as testing grounds for what ultimately goes into our products.<br>For example, Fedora is the open source community base for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, JBoss.org is the open source base for JBoss Middleware, Gluster.org is the open source base for Red Hat Storage, and oVirt is the upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization. The Linux Foundation said it would take 11 billion dollars to create what Fedora represents today, and Fedora continues to evolve and improve.',1);

Explain to customers that any savings can be used to innovate with their IT budget to meet business needs.<br>A subscription also demonstrates Red Hat&apos;s commitment to our customers and partners. It provides the back-end engineering, development, and testing necessary to create an enterprise-ready product. Every subscription supports an ecosystem of co-development where Red Hat and partners collaborate to certify hardware, software, and cloud provider solutions. The result of this certification program is that customers have access to the largest hardware and software ecosystem in the open source market. This is one of the most important components of the Red Hat model, as it certifies that customers can, in most cases, deploy Red Hat solutions on their existing hardware, eliminating the need for hardware upgrades.',1);

By investing in a small number of high-quality partners like you, we can commit and spend a lot more on providing you with the support and enablement services that will help you succeed. As we broaden our platform portfolio, we need specialized partners with specific integration, development, and systems management skills. The best partners participate in open source communities, which leads to tighter integration with Red Hat, better solutions for customers, and an improved reputation with customers. To support this &apos;less is more&apos; strategy, we have strict selection criteria for choosing partners; which means we only work with strong, skilled, and committed organizations.<br>Red Hat has a model that enables partners to sell more products or services by offering and implementing cost-effective Red Hat solutions, often starting with an open source operating system.
